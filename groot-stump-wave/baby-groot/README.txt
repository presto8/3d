# Summary

Hello, my version of baby Groot from the upcoming blockbuster movie "Guardians of the Galaxy 2". The model resembles the baby groots appearance in the trailers of the movie.
I recommend using the high detail version to capture all the details i put on. But if your slicer freezes/crashes, use low detail version, as the high detail version has several million polygons and requires more RAM/computing power to be sliced. There are 2 versions of the model, one with brim and one without brim. Use the version with the brim for better adhesion. You will have to remove the brim after print to assemble it. Last thing: The model may be rotated once imported. Thats because Zbrush takes Y-coordinate to be the up-direction. Don't forget it to rotate by 90 as in the photos. Happy printing.
Post update: Uploaded a non-separated version as some users wanted (height 15cm, untested, should be printed fine).

(Edit 3): As many people wishes per pm, i added the waving version (Tested and printed fine).
(Edit 4): I received a comment on the waving version and am told, that one hand is smaller that the other, and a Thingiverse user Devine (https://www.thingiverse.com/Devine/about) was very kind to send me a fixed version. I myself did not test it, but it should have addressed the above problem, plus this version has fewer polygons to solve some loading issue on weak machines. The file name is "Groot waiving fixed 1.stl".
