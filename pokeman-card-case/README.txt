# Summary

**Pokebox Card holder**

The Pokebox has a hinged top with latch and a release button to open it. It will hold over a 100 Pokemon cards. The inside of the box measures; 2.75" w x 1.69" d x 4" h. 

I went to design a Pokemon card holder for my son's birthday and thought that it would be cool to have a card holder with the same design as a pokeball but in a shape that will hold Pokemon cards. I had previously printed Intentional3D's Pokeball for my son and was very impressed with their design, so I used the same idea but made it into a cube shape to hold Pokemon cards.

**Instructions**
I think that its actually an easier print then the ball because the large pieces do not require supports since they are cubes and not spears.  I have uploaded two versions of the lid. There is a one piece version that requires support underneath the latch, it has a .05" overhang. Its so small it is possible that you could get away without support but I did not try.  Its important that this comes out correctly so it latches properly. The two piece version does not require support but it does require the latch to be printed separately and then glued to the lid. There are alignment guides to assist in gluing the catch in the correct position. 

After printing the required parts put the ring and the button in between the top and the bottom loops with a .75" long ball point pin spring behind the button and glue the rings together. Then glue the loop assembly onto to the base.  There are alignment guides so it can only be glued in the correct orientation  Attach the hinge on the lid to the hinge on the top loop using some 1.75mm diameter filament and glue the filament in place on both ends.
