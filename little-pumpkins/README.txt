# Summary

Nine different little low poly pumpkins ready to be printed for Halloween. Included are: Chompy, Slurpy, Crushy, Piercy, Slicey, Crunchy, Munchy, Smoochy and Squashy

They print quick without any support.

They can be stacked by snapping them together. LED lights can be put in them through the bottom.

Use single little pumpkins as decorations or stack them together then you can have them as a tower or hang them up.

Want to print them bigger and use a torch light with them? - Here is something for it: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1091056

# Print Settings

Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: Doesn't Matter
Infill: Doesn't Matter

Notes: 
The versions with Extra Edgy in the name prevent the printer from smoothing out the edges. If you like to print them significantly bigger I recommend printing the normal version.

1 pumpkin takes around 5 gram of filament so with 1kg filament you could print roughly 200 little pumpkins.

Print the Cross Stand if you like to build a tower with them. Note: Some of the snapping connections can be a bit shaky.
